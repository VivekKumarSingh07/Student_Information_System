\chapter{Future Enhancements}
ust like any other developer this project is the most basic website built using simple tools. We seek to increase the dynamic of the project by adding various other innovations to it. Such innovations would seem possible only with time, which we lack but regardless we strive to complete what we started.\\[0.1in]

We believe that apart from present functionalities we can add :

“HOBBIES” which will store the hobbies and extra cocurricular activities of the students.

“CONCURRENT PURCHASE” feature through which two teachers can log in and make changes at the same time.


“STUDENT LOGIN” so that each student may give his/her input on each teacher and subject. This can help in giving appreciation to teacher for their hard  work and the areas in which they can improve.\\[0.1in]


Apart from these changes we are open to various suggestions and hope to implement them soon so that this website can be used by the students for their needs.
